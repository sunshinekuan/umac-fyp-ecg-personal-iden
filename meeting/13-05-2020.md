# 13-05-2020 Meeting Notes

## Attendees
- Elaine, GUO YAN JIA (D-B3-0173-6)
- Oscar, KUAN KA MENG (D-B5-2625-8)

## Finished items (from the last meeting notes)
- Further training the model with Lab GPU computer.
- Developing the GUI application.
- Collected 3 person ECG signal.

## Discussion
- During this working period, we first trained our learning model by ECG-ID DB dataset by turning the gamma value to get the highest accuracy. Here is the tested value with corresponding accuracy got.

->
| Gamma Value  | Accuracy |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|    0.0001    |    0.336    |
|    0.001    |    0.40    |
|    0.01    |    0.58    |
|    0.1    |    0.61    |
|    0.5    |    0.624    |
|    0.6    |    0.55    |
|    0.7    |    0.54    |
|    0.8    |    0.55    |

- Then, the next step we use our own collecting ECG signal features dataset.
- The dataset contains 3 files, two of them contains approximately 30000 records of each. We use *Google Colaboratory* with GPU function. The highest accuracy we trained is 77.9%

## Challenges
- For the GUI application, 
  - How to demonstrate with AD8232 ECG collecting module?
  - What is the method to implement the identification with the model and AD8232? (Coding a function/Extract the validation part/â€¦)

## To do
- [ ] Finish the remaining part of the training model
- [ ] Finish the GUI application

## Schedule
- Next Meeting: May 2020 (if necessary)
