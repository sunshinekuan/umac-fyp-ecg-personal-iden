# 30-04-2020 Meeting Notes

## Attendees
- Elaine, GUO YAN JIA (D-B3-0173-6)
- Oscar, KUAN KA MENG (D-B5-2625-8)

## Finished items (from the last meeting notes)
- Further training and test the model with Lab GPU computer
- Developing the GUI application sample
- Collecting 2 person ECG signal

## Discussion
- Overview the training process 
  - *(Using Two person of each two features in Physionet ECG-ID Database to train a model. The training time is about 3 hours, and the accuracy is 0.61)*
  - *(Prof. Zhang recommanded that we needed to add more features set to train, aim to higher the accuarcy)*
- About the GUI application, we found the the Python library *TKinter* to develop the GUI. Now we can build the GUI sample applicaiton.
- We collected ECG signal from 2 person by AD8232 ECG Collecting Shield with Arduino.
  - *(From the collecting process, there may happen noise and other collecting problem. The analysis of signal after collecting is needed)*

## Challenges
- By now, the challenges is more less. the only challenge is the time is limited, we needed to keep the developing period more efficient.

## To do
- [ ] Further training the model with Lab GPU computer.
- [ ] Developing the GUI application.
- [ ] Collecting 4~8 person with about 30 minutes ECG signal.

## Schedule
- Next Meeting: May 2020
