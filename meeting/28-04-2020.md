# 28-04-2020 Meeting Notes

## Attendees
- Elaine, GUO YAN JIA (D-B3-0173-6)
- Oscar, KUAN KA MENG (D-B5-2625-8)

## Finished items (from the last meeting notes)
- According the lab (*E11-1050*) is available now, we test again the GPU computer in Lab is availabe. In addition, we installed the *Jupyter Notebook* with Python 3 in it. So, we can have a relatively effiecient way to code.
- From now, we confirmed we used SVM as the training algorithm. Therefore, we keep to choose Python 3 as the language we used.
- We tested our coding with a few of person's ECG features in the ECG-ID database, the validation accuracy is about 60%~80%.

## Discussion
- Overviewing the training model.
  - *(As the lab is available now, we can train by more ECG feature sets in the ECG-ID database according the compute power in higher.)*
- Further training step specification: Collecting 4~8 person with about 30 minutes ECG signal.
- Developing the GUI application.
- One teammate to continue develop the training model, another one to develop the GUI application.

## Challenges
- By now, the challenges is more less. the only challenge is the time is limited, we needed to keep the developing period more efficient.

## To do
- [ ] Further training the model with Lab GPU computer.
- [ ] Developing the GUI application.
- [ ] Collecting 4~8 person with about 30 minutes ECG signal.

## Schedule
- Next Meeting: 30 Apr 2020
  - *(To review the progress of GUI application)*
