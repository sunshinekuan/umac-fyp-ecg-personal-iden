# 12-02-2020 Meeting Notes

## Attendees
- Elaine, GUO YAN JIA (D-B3-0173-6)
- Oscar, KUAN KA MENG (D-B5-2625-8)

## Finished items (from the last meeting notes)
- None
  - (*According to the virus outbreak reason, we cannot enter the Lab.*)

## Discussion
- Discuss the current progress and situation.
- We change to use *Google Colab Notebook* (like Jupyter Notebook) with Python 3 to build up the deeping learning model to instead of Lab GPU computer.
- Because of the remaining time is limited, decide to keep the original deep learning method, or change to the another algorithm (such as *traditional recognition* method).
- Plan the "Working Schedule" with checkpoint.

## Challenges
- The time is limited. Needed to set a plan of developing and coming report task.
- For the reason of virus outbreak, we cannot use the powerful GPU computer to train the model. We needed to decide keep the original deep learning method, or change to the another algorithm (such as *traditional recognition* method).

## To do
- [ ] Plan the "Working Schedule" with checkpoint.
- [ ] Find and test the exist framework and dataset.
- [ ] During the data training process, adjust the pooling, learning rate, etc. to confirm the reasonable accuracy.
- [ ] Record the accuracy, running time and fitting problem. Find the optimal one.

## Schedule
- Next Meeting: TBC (In Mar 2020)
  - (For the reason of Prof. Zhang have a leave in this semester and virus outbreak, the coming meetings will use online tools.)
