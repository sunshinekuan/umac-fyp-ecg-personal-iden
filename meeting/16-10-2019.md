- Oscar, KUAN KA MENG (D-B5-2625-8)

## Finished items (from the last meeting notes)
- Find William to set the lab computer. 
*(Situation: Requested. The lab computer is not settled yet. Follow-up with William is needed.)*

## Discussion
As the required lab computers is not settled yet, this meeting focus on review and checking the availability of coming tasks. The followings are the focus points:
- Requested the GPU accounts first, rather than the computers.
- As the related ECG (with deep learning) reference material is not too much, the inputs is not so clear, we need to do it in an early time. Make sure we have the time to tune the model.
- We try to build the environment in our own laptop, but Prof. Zhang is not suggested.
- All the unfinished tasks postpone due to next meeting.

## Challenges
- The setting of the environment, model and the training process is not clear.

## To do
- [ ] Learn about one dimensional deep learning framework.
- [ ] Set up the deep learning enviroment.
- [ ] Input several 1000-heartbeat datasets into the model, try to input the data from dataset, even cannot run the result part.
- [ ] Find another heartbeat detect device. *(Optional)*

## Schedule
- Next meet time: October 30, 10:30am
