# 18-02-2020 Meeting Notes

## Attendees
- Elaine, GUO YAN JIA (D-B3-0173-6)
- Oscar, KUAN KA MENG (D-B5-2625-8)

## Finished items (from the last meeting notes)
- Trying and Familiaring to use the funciton of *Google Colab Notebook* with Python 3.

## Discussion
- Discuss the current progress and situation.
- Trying to use *Google Colab Notebook* with Python 3 (discussed in the meeting time). In the current step, it can be successfully to run the simple Python program.
- Because of the remaining time is limited, decide to keep the original deep learning method, or change to the another algorithm (such as *traditional recognition* method).

## Challenges
- The time is limited. Needed to set a plan of developing and coming report task.
- For the reason of virus outbreak, we cannot use the powerful GPU computer to train the model. We needed to decide keep the original deep learning method, or change to the another algorithm (such as *traditional recognition* method).

## To do
- [ ] Plan the "Working Schedule" with checkpoint.
- [ ] Find and test the exist framework and dataset.
- [ ] During the data training process, adjust the pooling, learning rate, etc. to confirm the reasonable accuracy.
- [ ] Record the accuracy, running time and fitting problem. Find the optimal one.

## Schedule
- Next Meeting: TBC
  - (For the reason of Prof. Zhang have a leave in this semester and virus outbreak, the coming meetings will use online tools.)
